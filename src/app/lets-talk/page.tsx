              <p>
                I&apos;ve been building software for 15+ years. Currently Staff
                Engineer at HelloFresh, working on AI-driven customer service
                and modernizing platforms that have seen better days.
              </p>

              <p>
                Software should be a craft, not something we constantly
                apologize for. I&apos;ve seen too many systems that work great
                in demos but collapse under real load. My focus is building
                things that actually work â€” and that your team can sleep soundly
                knowing they won&apos;t break at 3 AM.
              </p>

              <h2>What I Do</h2>

              <p>
                I help untangle complex technical messes. Architecture reviews,
                legacy system migrations, scaling challenges â€” if it&apos;s a
                gnarly technical problem, I&apos;ve probably wrestled with
                something similar.
              </p>

              <p>Recent examples:</p>

              <p>
                â€¢ Led Deutsche Telekom&apos;s customer portal rebuild (200+
                engineers, somehow didn&apos;t go insane)
                <br />
                â€¢ Designed event-driven systems that actually stay up
                <br />
                â€¢ Migrated monoliths without the usual &quot;everything is on
                fire&quot; experience
                <br />â€¢ Built AI chatbots that help instead of making people
                want to throw their phones
              </p>

              <h2>Tech I Work With</h2>

              <p>
                Started with Java (13 years, even got the Oracle cert to prove
                it) but recently fell hard for Go. If you&apos;ve read my blog,
                you know the story. These days it&apos;s mostly Go, AWS
                (Bedrock, EKS, the usual suspects), and enough
                JavaScript/TypeScript to be dangerous.
              </p>

              <p>
                I&apos;m exploring Rust because memory safety without garbage
                collection is pretty compelling. But honestly? I&apos;m
                suspicious of anything that looks too clever. Simple usually
                wins.
              </p>

              <h2>How This Works</h2>

              <p>
                Think I might be able to help? Just reach out. We&apos;ll chat
                about what you&apos;re dealing with, see if it makes sense, and
                go from there.
              </p>

              <p>
                No elaborate discovery processes or corporate theater. Just
                engineers talking through problems.
